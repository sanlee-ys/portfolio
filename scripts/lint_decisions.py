"""Lint this repo's ADRs for the 'Downstream surfaces' section.

Why this exists, concretely: in the classifier repo, `ADR-014` shipped the `region`
axis on 2026-07-18 with no `## Downstream surfaces` section. The sweep that followed
updated two eval modules and missed a third file that had not been touched in a week
and knew nothing about a new axis, leaving an automated loop able to silently delete
the new rubric. Nobody noticed for a day.

The `architecture` repo has enforced this section on its `SYS-NNN` documents since
2026-07-18, and the classifier ported it to its own ADRs on 2026-07-19. This repo's
`decisions/` tier had no check at all — which is the same gap one level down, and the
reason a decision here could ship without anyone being asked what it touches.

Deliberately narrow. It does NOT try to verify that the listed surfaces are correct or
complete — a linter cannot know that. It only enforces that the author was made to
think about it and write the list down, which is the step that gets skipped.

RATCHETED: documents in ``LEGACY_NO_DOWNSTREAM`` are grandfathered and the list may
only shrink. **It is empty here** — every ADR in this repo already carries the section,
so the rule is enforced with no exceptions and any new ADR must comply.

Usage:
    python scripts/lint_decisions.py      # locally
    python3 scripts/lint_decisions.py     # CI (the QA job sets up Node, not Python,
                                          # so only python3 is guaranteed there)

(Stdlib only, no venv — this repo is static HTML/CSS/JS with no Python toolchain, and
a doc linter is not a reason to grow one.)
